title: Probability and Stochastic Processes in Biology
---

> **Spring 2024--Simon Fraser University**

## Course Overview
The natural world is inherently random. Describing, understanding, and predicting phenomena in Ecology, Evolution, and Epidemiology therefore requires the use of mathematical models that explicitly include this randomness.  In this course we will cover methods and applications of probability, stochastic processes, and computer simulation to these three fields.

**Litterature Review**

For the litterature review we will be discussing chapters from Lande et al. 2003: "Stochastic Population Dynamics in Ecology and Conservation".  Each student/pair of students will pick a chapter to review & present.  Students are encourage to collaborate to understand and develop connections between chapters. Each student will:
- Submit a 2pg review of their focal chapter. Litterature review should include connection to 1 (3 for 795) additional relevent reference.
- Present a 12min(+3min Q&A) presentation introducing and summarizing the material from their selected chapter, the additional references chosen, and any connections to other chapters.
